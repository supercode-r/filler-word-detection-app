Expanded Filler List: Threw in more common fillers based on what people tend to say when they’re nervous or stalling. You could even let users customize this in the app settings!

Speech Recognition: I hooked in the speech_recognition library (you’d need to pip install SpeechRecognition and PyAudio). It’s a quick way to get mic input working. Google’s API is online-only, but PocketSphinx works offline if you want that.

Vibration Placeholder: The vibrate_device() function is still a stub. For a real app, you’d use something like Kivy with PyJNIus (Android) or PyObjC (iOS) to call native vibration APIs. I can dive deeper into that if you pick a platform!

Threading: Speech recognition runs in the background so it doesn’t freeze the app. Super important for a smooth user experience.

Error Handling: Added basic checks for empty transcriptions, audio issues, etc., so it doesn’t crash mid-presentation.

Debouncing: A tiny sleep after each vibration to avoid a buzz storm if someone says “um like uh” in one breath.
